1. in simulate_scenes - run the different scenes in parallel
2. configure mujoco to use GPUs
3. consider using Cupy everywhere Numpy is used



adjusting individual code for different robots and sceneries doesn't make sense - just the simulator and running in aprallel everything

research ideas
1. code for the modular robot body could be auto generated
2. the brain could be vLLM and use language to describe the task instead of writing code could also be auto optimized
3. the weights of the VLLM can be tuned with LoRa and evolutionary approach
